#lecture about static
####################
#static methods and data are instance bound
#this means that it applies to the class but not the objects of the class
#statics vs non statics are hard to understand
#all instances of the class will share the static data
#changing static data for one instance of class will change for all instances of class
#non static variables are associated with objects, but static variables are associated with classes
#can access with object name or class name
#classname.staticfloat() or object1.staticfloat()
