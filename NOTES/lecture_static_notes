#lecture about static
####################
#static methods and data are instance bound
#this means that it applies to the class but not the objects of the class
#statics vs non statics are hard to understand
#all instances of the class will share the static data
#changing static data for one instance of class will change for all instances of class
#non static variables are associated with objects, but static variables are associated with classes
#can access with object name or class name
#classname.staticfloat() or object1.staticfloat()
#############################
#raise excpetions with command throw new Exception("error message")
###############################
#static methods cannot access instance variables
#there is a static constructor for initializing static variables
#java.lang.Math is a collection of static values and methods
#factory method: produces an object from within an object
#static factory method is alternative to constructor statement
#learn static factory methods, these notes are slim

#string notes
##########
#java strings are immutable
#immutability of strings has serious performance problems
#string concat is really inefficient (avoid if possible)
#arrays are faster? you can store string chars in array and print the array that way
#all data in R is immutable
#immutable data slow down performance (overwrite and garbage collection)
#StringBuffer is 20 times faster than strings
#a buffer is a mutable string
#StringBuffer buff = new StringBuffer();
#buff.append(x)
#thats better than string concat
