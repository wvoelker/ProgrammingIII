#notes for threads and how to use
###################################3
#class called thread in java
#extends Thread
#@Override run method in thread to tell thread what to do
#all threads have thread ID which is final
##################################
#when multithreading, final is essential (threads cause problems by trying to modify stuff without permission)
#run does not throw an exception
#so try-catch might be important
#the semaphore class makes code run in parallel
#each worker has own number and reference to semaphore
#private final Semaphore semaphore;
#always release semaphore in finally block to release 'pass'
#semaphore.release()
#worker implements runnable
#x.aquire() to get license
#x.release() to give it back
#do not allow threads to access data at same time
