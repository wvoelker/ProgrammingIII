#notes on HashSets, Hashcode, and Iterators
############################################
#sets are alternative collection to list
#Set is not ordered (like list)
#sets cannot have duplicates
#SortedSet is set with order
#sets don't have indexes
#collection interface contains lists and sets
#Bloch says that you should work at highest level of abstraction you can (to keep flexibility in code)
###########################################
#you can use sets to remove duplicates from list easily
##############################
#equals() and hashCode()
#hash function turns data into ones and zeros (an address to a bucket)
#you can jump to any bucket with address (don't have to iterate)
#hash function works in constant time
#hashCode() is a function in java that applies to object interface
#so all objects have a hashCode()
#only rule for hashcode function is that same thing must return same hashcode
#Sneakers - movie about reverse hashcodes - watch this later
#can take any number of bits as the bucket address
