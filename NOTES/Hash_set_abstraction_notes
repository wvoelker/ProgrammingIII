#notes on HashSets, Hashcode, and Iterators
############################################
#sets are alternative collection to list
#Set is not ordered (like list)
#sets cannot have duplicates
#SortedSet is set with order
#sets don't have indexes
#collection interface contains lists and sets
#Bloch says that you should work at highest level of abstraction you can (to keep flexibility in code)
###########################################
#you can use sets to remove duplicates from list easily
##############################
#equals() and hashCode()
#hash function turns data into ones and zeros (an address to a bucket)
#you can jump to any bucket with address (don't have to iterate)
#hash function works in constant time
#hashCode() is a function in java that applies to object interface
#so all objects have a hashCode()
#only rule for hashcode function is that same thing must return same hashcode
#Sneakers - movie about reverse hashcodes - watch this later
#can take any number of bits as the bucket address
####################################3
#HashSet<something> set = new Hashset<something>();
#obey general contract when overriding equals function
##reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent, x.equals(null) should always be false
#in order to ensure that two objects that are equal in hashmaps you must override the hashCode() function
#ALWAYS override hashcode if overriding equals()
#never introduce indeterminism in programs without random factors
#Double(value).hashCode(); will override hashcode with better function
#hashCode function should be determined using same values that equals is used
#dont modify collections when iterating through collection
#Hashset/Hashmap is fastest collection api
#TreeSet is a slower set, but ordered by comparator 
######################################
#lecture 11 - Hash maps
##################
#maps have a key and value - like dictionaries!
#Hail Mary Project - read this book!
#maps are very literally just dictionaries
#map.get(key) = value
#Treemap will keep it in order if you want an ordered dictionary
#maps only hold objects(not primitives)
#maps are good for counting things
#linkedhashmap is order of iteration
#############################
#finally garuntees that a block of code will execute (if,else,finally)
#Jframe is java gui object
#MyFrame extends Jframe
#java.swing.Jframe
#BorderLayout class: 5 zones
#layout manager objects tells java how compenents should be layed out in space
#sun tutorial for gui mockups
#add ActionListener interface to respond to user inputs
