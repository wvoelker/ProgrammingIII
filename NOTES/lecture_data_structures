#lists and arrays lecture
#######################
#collections api (data structures i think?)
#strings and arrays in java are seperate
#iteration in arrays
#for(String string: anArrayofSomething){do something}
#strings and arrays are not interchangable(you can't index strings)
#Arrays.sort(somearray) sorts any array of anything (different sort criteria for different data types)
#Arrays.binarysearch(somearray,query) will print out the index
#lists (unlike arrays) can change size
#arrays are a fixed size
#lots of methods that can be called on lists 
#an array is an implementation of the list interface
#######################################
#INTERFACES
#an interface is just a collection of function names
#interface is added through 'implements' commmand
#class circle implements shape
#class square implements shape
#stops compilation if methods in shape interface are not in either class
#this allows you to define collection api (list or array) to contain shapes instead of either object
