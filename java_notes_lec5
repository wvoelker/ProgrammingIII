//Programming notes, actual java code now//
#import java.util.RANDOM; get random class
#Random random = new Random() #this is the random generator
#take numbers out of it by random.nextInt()
#write code to print the console 1,000 randomly generated DNA 3 mers
#have code track how ofter it prints out the 3 mer AAA
#modify code frequencies (check lecture on website)
#check expected frequency 
#float f = random.nextFloat()

#actual notes
#different data types will not always be ==, but they can be, generally try to keep data types the same i think
#rounding errors can occur over large or small numbers because of the limit to the number of bits
#== does not work well on strings
#can be bypassed with inString.equals(s1)
#System.out.println() to print
#minimize scope of local variables!!!
#for loop structure for(initialization;condition;action){another action}
#unreachable code is a compile error
#nested for loops are necessary
#think about performance!! N^2 bubble sort sucks
#arrays.sort is better, merge.sort is better
#look up locking specific git folders in repository? would make things much easier
