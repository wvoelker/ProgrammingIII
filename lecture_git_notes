//NOTES FOR LECTURE 3: GIT
##some more overview of lecture 1
#brief description of data types in object oriented programming
#encapsulation is in java but not in python
#java has classes
#data of a class in memory is a object (a realized class)
#all objects in java are on heap (in c data goes on stack not heap)
#in c, memory had to be manually allocated (got rid of by garbage collection, which removes objects from memory automatically when you are done)
#garbage collection is very important to modern programming (but this means that there is no control of memory allocation)
