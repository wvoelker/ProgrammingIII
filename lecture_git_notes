//NOTES FOR LECTURE 3: GIT
##some more overview of lecture 1
#brief description of data types in object oriented programming
#encapsulation is in java but not in python
#java has classes
#data of a class in memory is a object (a realized class)
#all objects in java are on heap (in c data goes on stack not heap)
#in c, memory had to be manually allocated (got rid of by garbage collection, which removes objects from memory automatically when you are done)
#garbage collection is very important to modern programming (but this means that there is no control of memory allocation)

##actual git notes here##
#this isn't going to include branching
#creating a repository
#can be done through website
#once a repository is made, it can be viewed as webpage on git
#git clone command with url will copy repository to local directory
#from working directory, file or changes are staged then committed then pushed into git
#git checkout command? jumps between different branches
#git status - gives status of files in repository
#git remote gives list of remote repositories
#git push origin main(or master) == git push remote repository name + repository branch
#git log gives you history of repository
#git diff does something but im not really sure
#git fetch - grabs latest commits from remote database
#git merge tries to merge commits
